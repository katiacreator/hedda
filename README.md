# Hedda
Hedda is a minimalist Django application that allows a user to keep track of all the timers for each step in a (sourdough) bread baking process. There are around 20 meticulous steps that go into making a proper sourdough loaf so timing is essential. This app helps the user keep track of all the timers they use by storing them all in one place.

# Why the name Hedda?
I named this app after the sourdough starter my friend uses to make her sourdough bread. Hedda is very much a living breathing being, so she was given a proper name from my friend's family heritage. Fun fact: One of the name meanings is 'Vigorous battle maiden'. Hedda once crushed the lid of her container and shot it across the room in the middle of the night, causing confusion by the humans in the household, but she was just living up to her name.
