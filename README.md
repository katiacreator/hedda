# Hedda

Hedda is a Django application that allows a user to keep track of all the timers for each step in a (sourdough) bread baking process. There are around 20 meticulous steps that go into making a proper sourdough loaf so timing is essential. This app helps the user keep track of all the timers they use by storing them all in one place.

# Why the name Hedda?
I named this app after the sourdough starter the primary user of this app uses to make her sourdough bread. Hedda is very much a living breathing being, so she was given a proper name from the user's heritage.
